    <p>Fitness Trends can influence people who work-out and those involved in the fitness business. According to a recent survey, the wellness industry is a $3.7 trillion business and is expected to grow 17 per cent in the next five years. Below are some of the emerging fitness trends that will change the face of the fitness industry in 2019.
</p>
<strong>Virtual Reality Workouts</strong>
<p>Technology has made its way into every industry and it entered the fitness industry way back. From Fitness Trackers to Smart Gyms, technology has revamped the fitness industry.</p>
<p>Now there’s a new form of workout emerging involving modern technology- virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) workouts. Gone are the days when people used to work out in front of the TV or with loud music. Now with the emergence of AR and VR, people exercise in an entirely different world, with images superimposed onto your field of view.

</p>
<p>This technology is expanding at an unprecedented rate, with many gyms and health clubs already implementing it to make workout fun for members and also increase their profits.

</p>
<p><strong>More Than Just a Gym</strong></p>
<p>The fitness industry is constantly evolving. Fitness Enthusiasts now expect more from their gyms or fitness centres. Services such as spa therapies, Jacuzzis, saunas, supplements etc. that offer a holistic wellness experience are desired by most of the customers. Low-cost gym and basic equipment are slowly being overpowered by cutting-edge classes, high-tech machines and active communities.

</p>
<p><strong>Athleisure</strong></p>
<p>Gym wears are making their way out of the gym and becoming an important part of people’s wardrobe. Athleisure is a recent fashion trend in which clothing designed for workouts and other athletic activities can be worn in other settings.

</p>
<p>With many celebrities donning the athleisure look, it has become a hit fashion statement among the millennials and the market is largely dominated by them. Athleisure bridges the gap that was there in the marketplace for fitness apparel and accessories that are as fashionable as they are functional.
